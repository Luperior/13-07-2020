C++ project to emulate SQL Language and store different kind of values inside tables. It is also possible to edit, search and sort them. Further details can be found in the attached pdf.

This project was part of the exam for the "Algoritmi e calcolatori" course of the Electronic Engineering Bachelor's Degree at Politecnico di Torino. 

PS: this version of the project allows the usage of different operators, rather than just = (Equal). These are > (Greater than), < (Less than), >= (Greater than or equal), <= (Less than or equal), and <> (Not equal). It is also possible to use the BETWEEN keyword, for example "SELECT ID, AGE, SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE BETWEEN 20 AND 30" will output all selected records where AGE is >= 20 and <= 30.
